# AutoGen Book Generator

A Python-based system that uses AutoGen to generate a series of stories which are independent and non-repetitive through collaborative AI agents. The system employs multiple specialized agents working together to create coherent, structured narratives from initial prompts.

## Features

- Multi-agent collaborative writing system
- Structured chapter generation with consistent formatting
- Maintains  a series of stories independent and non-repetitive
- Automated world-building and setting management
- Built-in validation and error handling

## Architecture

The system uses several specialized agents:

- **Story Planner**: Creates high-level story arcs and plot points
- **World Builder**: Establishes and maintains consistent settings
- **Memory Keeper**: Tracks continuity and context
- **Writer**: Generates the actual prose
- **Editor**: Reviews and improves content
- **Outline Creator**: Creates detailed outlines of each story.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/huqianghui/AI-Stories-Generator.git
cd AI-Stories-Generator
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Basic usage:
```python
from main import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

2. Custom initial prompt:
```python
initial_prompt = " your settings"
```

## Configuration

The system can be configured through `config.py`. Key configurations include:

- LLM endpoint URL
- Number of stories
- Agent parameters
- Output directory settings

## Output Structure

Generated content is saved in the `story_output` directory:
```
story_output/
├── outline.txt
├── story_01.txt
├── story_02.txt
└── ...
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- AutoGen 0.2.0+
- Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling:
- Validates story completeness
- Ensures proper formatting
- Maintains backup copies of generated content
- Implements retry logic for failed generations

## Limitations

- Requires significant computational resources
- Generation time increases with story count
- Quality depends on the underlying LLM model
- May require manual review for final polish
